# RobloxWebsiteClone
In this project, I recreated a very popular page in roblox from scratch.

From this project I learned a lot about HTML and CSS and earned some basic
  knowledge on website responsivity.

Nowdays the Roblox developer team have created a new login page so my version
  is rather old.
